        <h1>Baked Celeriac Macaroni with a Crispy Olive Top</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a take on a classic mac and cheese, but the sauce comes from some sweet roasted celeriac and plump butter beans. It's lighter and way les cloying than a straight-up mac and cheese, but still creamy, satisfying and full of flavour. I top it off with some cavalo nero (or kale), a few walnuts and black olives, which crisps to form a colourful textured crown that elevates this to another level. I add a little Permesan to the sauce, but nutritional yeast works really well here if you'd prefer to keep it completely free of cheese.</p>
