        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This ia a quick breezy summer breakfast for when porridge is a distant memory. I first at ea breakfast like this in Brazil, where icy a√ßai bowls are the breakfast of choice in the juice bars that line the streets off Rio's beaches. This is my British summer version. It's essentially a thin frozen yoghurt, the right consistency for spooning, with some chia seeds for texture and energy. I have left the toppings up to you; use what you have on had to add texture, flavour and some prettiness. You can use frozen berries if you like, in which cse I'd recommend leaving out the ice cubes. I use a mixture of summer berries (e.g. raspberries, strawberries and redcurrants).</p>
